# root.src

**root.src** is a decentralized verification and identity layer built on **Handshake (HNS)**, **IPFS**, and **blockchain protocols**. It enables cryptographically secure identity anchoring, content verification, and archiving of AI-generated or user-generated data across decentralized networks.

## 🔍 Overview

As the internet becomes increasingly reliant on trustless systems, **root.src** aims to provide a framework for:

- Verifiable digital identities via Handshake
- Decentralized content storage using IPFS
- Permanent archival via Arweave
- Immutable proof and timestamping through Ethereum or Polygon

## 🌐 Core Components

### 🧩 root.src (Framework Layer)
- Interfaces with decentralized systems
- Manages input/output of verification logic
- Coordinates archive and hashing logic

### 🗂 Archive Layer
- Stores AI-generated responses, answers, or user-submitted content
- Each entry is hashed and linked to decentralized storage
- Content is timestamped and anchored on-chain

### 📦 Storage + Identity Stack

| Component         | Purpose                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Handshake**     | Decentralized domain and root identity         |
| **IPFS**          | Decentralized hosting for content              |
| **Arweave**       | Permanent storage and archival of data         |
| **Ethereum/Polygon** | Immutable proof of archive hash + metadata   |

## ✅ Use Cases

- Verifiable historical records and AI answers
- Immutable timestamped facts
- Decentralized identities for content creators and data publishers
- Web3-based fact-checking and source attribution


## 🛠 Future Plans

- Integration with Ceramic or other DID standards
- DAO governance for trusted verifiers
- Public explorer for archive entries and verification status
- API for submitting and verifying content hashes
